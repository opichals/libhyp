This is an example of how to work with libhyp library.
The library is used only in the .c files to generate
very simple 'pseudo html' output.

In addition to those libhyp usage examples it also
provides a set of perl CGI scripts to run libhyp inside
a CGI capable web server to allow any web browser
view the .HYP files.

This service is also available online at the following
URL where you can browse any .HYP file accessble from
the web:
