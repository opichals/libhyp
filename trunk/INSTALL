libhyp: ST-Guide HYPertext file handling library
Copyright (c) 2005-2006 Standa Opichal / JAY Software


At this time there is no automation of the build
whatsoever. The build system is based on GNU make
and is extremely simple. To successfully build on a
target system modifications to configuration files
and/or Makefiles might be needed.


In general the build is to be done as follows:

# build the libhyp.a
cd src
make

# build the dependent examples
cd ../tools/hypviewcgi
make


That's all for now.


Enjoy
