#ST-Guide .HYP file parser library written in C

The tools folder contains an example of how to work with the libhyp library. The library is used only in the .c files to generate very simple 'pseudo html' output.

In addition to those libhyp usage examples it also provides a set of perl based CGI scripts to allow any web browser view the .HYP files.
